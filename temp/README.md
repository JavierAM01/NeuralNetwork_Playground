This project brings machine learning to life with an interactive neural network platform, designed for users to create, train, and test models on familiar examples such as MNIST classification, linear and non-linear regression, and clustering. The platform features real-time visualizations of error metrics throughout training, allowing users to monitor their model's progress and refine hyperparameters for better results. A unique 28x28 drawing board lets users test their digit recognition models with custom inputs, adding a hands-on experience to machine learning.

To ensure a seamless experience, extensive software testing was conducted, establishing robust communication between the JavaScript frontend and server across clustered computers. Additionally, our team focused on enhancing user experience through targeted surveys and analysis, incorporating feedback to improve accessibility and functionality. Whether you're new to neural networks or an experienced data scientist, this platform offers a practical and intuitive way to explore, experiment, and understand machine learning models.
